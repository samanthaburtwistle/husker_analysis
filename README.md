# husker_analysis
Analyzing Tweets from the Nebraska Huskers vs. Ohio State Buckeyes college football game on 9/28. This repository includes code using Tweepy to get the Tweets streaming in real time (huskerStreamer), the .csv file of the results (cleaned results at cleanedGameTweets2.csv), and Jupyter notebooks performing basic data cleaning (tweet_cleaning.ipyb) and analysis (huskerTweetAnalysis.ipynb). The most common words in tweets are also available in mostCommonWords.csv, nebraskaWords.csv (the most common words from Nebraskan users), and ohioWords.csv (the most common words for Ohioan users). 

Visualization of the results is available at my Tableau Public page: https://public.tableau.com/views/HuskerAnalysis/Dashboard1?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link
